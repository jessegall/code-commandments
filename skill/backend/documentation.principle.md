A docblock and a comment are not free: every line a reader must scan costs them time, and a line that just
restates the code, or narrates how it got here, wastes that time for nothing. The bar is high —
write a doc only when it tells the reader something the code itself does not.

Docs are still **wanted**, not banned. A short docblock on a class or method is good and expected: one
sentence saying what it *is* or *does*, plus the `@param` / `@return` / `@throws` type contract. Keep it to
a line or two, present-tense, about the code as it is now — never *how* it works internally, *why* it
changed, or what it *used to* be. Git holds the history; when you replace code, just replace it — don't leave
a comment explaining what it used to be.

Inline comments are the rarest of all — default to none. The code already says *what* it does; the only
comment worth writing explains a non-obvious **why** the code can't: a hidden invariant, a workaround for an
external bug, a constraint the reader can't infer. (A structural section divider in a large class is fine
if the codebase already uses them — structural, not narrative.) Everything else: don't write it.
