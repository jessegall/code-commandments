A variadic, named-argument method — `copyWith(mixed ...$changes)`, a `with…()` builder — is a flexible,
low-level API: it maps whatever named arguments you pass onto the object. That flexibility is the point at
ONE call site. Across many, writing the *same* named argument the *same* way each time is duplication with
a tell: you've discovered a specific operation the type should name.

### The smell

The same shape recurs at site after site:

```php
$element->copyWith(metadata: PortInputPayload::from([...])->toArray());
```

Three things repeat every time: the `copyWith(metadata: …)` call, the `PortInputPayload::from([...])` build,
and the `->toArray()` flatten — your **two arrays** (the literal you write, then the array `toArray()`
returns). The low-level `with`-call is doing a specific job that has no name.

### The fix: name the operation on the type

Give the receiver's type the method the call sites keep spelling out:

```php
public function withMetadata(PortInputPayload $payload): static
{
    return $this->copyWith(metadata: $payload->toArray());
}
```

Now every site is `$element->withMetadata($payload)` — the `copyWith` mapping and the `from(…)->toArray()`
wrap live in ONE place, named for what they do. The generic `copyWith` stays for the genuinely one-off
change; the operation you kept repeating becomes first-class.

### When it is NOT this sin

- **A one-off.** A `with`-call written once is exactly what the flexible API is for — no method needed.
- **Genuinely different arguments.** If each site passes a *different* named argument (`copyWith(label: …)`
  here, `copyWith(icon: …)` there), there is no single operation to name.
- **Unrelated types.** Two different classes that both happen to have a `copyWith` are not one operation;
  only calls that resolve to the *same* method (the same class, or one it inherits) count as repetition.
